# TASK-_4-Loops-Iterations

# 📁 Project: Python Loop Demonstration

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Python**
- **VS Code**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to help interns and beginners understand **iteration and automation** using Python loops.  
It demonstrates how `for` loops and `while` loops work through practical and real-world examples.

---

## 📄 Project File
- `loop_tasks.py`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `break` and `continue`
- `range()` with steps
- Loop conditions
- Iterating over strings
- Real-world loop use cases

---

## 🧪 Tasks Implemented

### 1️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to 100
Uses a **for loop** with `range()` to print numbers sequentially.

---

### 2️⃣ Countdown Timer
Uses a **while loop** to create a countdown from 10 to 1.

---

### 3️⃣ Break and Continue
Demonstrates:
- `continue` to skip a value
- `break` to exit a loop early

---

### 4️⃣ Iterate Over a String
Loops through each character in a string to show character iteration.

---

### 5️⃣ Multiplication Table
Generates the multiplication table of 5 using a loop.

---

### 6️⃣ Range with Steps
Prints even numbers from 2 to 20 using `range(start, stop, step)`.

---

### 7️⃣ Loop with Conditions
Checks whether numbers are **even or odd** using conditional logic inside a loop.

---

### 8️⃣ Real-World Example: Attendance System
Simulates marking attendance for a list of students.

---

### 9️⃣ Real-World Example: Password Attempts
Uses a `while` loop to limit login attempts and simulate account lockout.

# 🎯 Final Outcome

## After completing this project, an intern will be able to:

- Understand how loops work in Python

- Apply iteration to automate tasks

- Use for and while loops correctly

- Control loops using break and continue

- Apply loops in real-world programming scenarios

## 📚 Recommended Next Steps

- Add user input to loops

- Convert examples into functions

- Add error handling

- Practice nested loops
